Shanghai Taxi Trip Patterns and Income Analysis

⸻

Project Overview

This project analyzes Shanghai taxi GPS binary trajectory logs to uncover urban taxi trip patterns, build road-segment (node) state transition matrices, and simulate expected income and costs under multi-order scenarios. We compare different node selection methods (Top K-core, Top Degree) to evaluate their impact on taxi empty travel time. Additionally, Folium heatmaps visualize citywide taxi demand distributions, making the experiments both visual and reproducible.
